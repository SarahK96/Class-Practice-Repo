# Class Practice Repo

Publicly shared class repo. For practicing, class activities, etc.

## Initial steps
Fork this repository into your GitHub account. Then, clone your fork to your local machine: 

    git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/Class-Practice-Repo.git

Add the original repository as the "upstream" remote repository. 

    cd <your-cloned-repo>
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/naraehan/Class-Practice-Repo.git

## Submitting to-do tasks

The routine goes like:

1. Move into your local repo. 

2. Start by syncing with the original upstream: 

```git
	git pull upstream master
```

3. Move into the current assignment directory (todo1, todo2, etc.)

4. Work on your submission file. Name it `todo1_yourname.txt` or something like it. 

5. Don't forget to commit and save your progress while working on your file. Also, check status via `git status`. 

6. Occasionally push it to your GitHub remote fork ("origin"). 

7. When you think you have a final version, push it one last time to your GitHub remote fork. Check the file on GitHub to make sure everything looks fine. 

8. Create a pull request for me.
