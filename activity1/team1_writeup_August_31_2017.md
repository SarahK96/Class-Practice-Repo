## Dataset #1, 

### Annotated Learner Texts
- Annotated sample of timed and untimed essays by heritage and second language learners from the Russian Learner Corpus of Academic Writing (RULEC)
- Author: Gina Peirce (2016)
- Abstract: This sample of 232 student essays is drawn from RULEC, the Russian Learner Corpus of Academic Writing, which contains texts written for class assignments by heritage and second language (L2) learners enrolled in Portland State University's Russian Language Flagship program between 2008 and 2013. In addition to learner type, the sample is divided between essays that students wrote with and without a time limit; that is, under both timed and untimed conditions. Using oXygen XML Editor software, a native Russian-speaking graduate student in the University of Pittsburghâ€™s Department of Linguistics annotated all inflectional morphology errors on nouns, adjectives and determiners in the sample texts. Additionally, all T-units (sentences or independent clauses with any accompanying dependent clauses) in the texts have been annotated by the author of the thesis for which this sample was used, "Representational and Processing Constraints on the Acquisition of Case and Gender by L1 English Learners of Russian: A Corpus Study," by Gina M. Peirce (University of Pittsburgh, Department of Linguistics, 2015). These annotations enable comparative analysis of rates of morphological errors per T-unit for the different learner types and conditions included in the sample.

Questions:
- What kind of data set is this? Content? Format? Purpose?
    - This is a dataset of timed and untimed essays by both heritage and second language learners learning Russian. 
- How was the data created, collected, and processed?
    - The 232 student essays are drawn from RULEC, the Russian Learner Corpus of Academic Writing. Errors in the data are determined by a native Russian-speaker and indicated in XML. Also, all "T-units", or sentence/independent clauses with any accompanying dependent clauses, are annotated.
- The researcher organized the data into 4 folders, "Heritage Learners Timed Texts", "Heritage Learners Untimed Texts", "L2 Learners Timed Texts" and "L2 Learners Untimed Texts"
