### Annotated Learner Texts
- Annotated sample of timed and untimed essays by heritage and second language learners from the Russian Learner Corpus of Academic Writing (RULEC)
- Author: Gina Peirce (2016)
- Abstract: This sample of 232 student essays is drawn from RULEC, the Russian Learner Corpus of Academic Writing, which contains texts written for class assignments by heritage and second language (L2) learners enrolled in Portland State University's Russian Language Flagship program between 2008 and 2013. In addition to learner type, the sample is divided between essays that students wrote with and without a time limit; that is, under both timed and untimed conditions. Using oXygen XML Editor software, a native Russian-speaking graduate student in the University of Pittsburghâ€™s Department of Linguistics annotated all inflectional morphology errors on nouns, adjectives and determiners in the sample texts. Additionally, all T-units (sentences or independent clauses with any accompanying dependent clauses) in the texts have been annotated by the author of the thesis for which this sample was used, "Representational and Processing Constraints on the Acquisition of Case and Gender by L1 English Learners of Russian: A Corpus Study," by Gina M. Peirce (University of Pittsburgh, Department of Linguistics, 2015). These annotations enable comparative analysis of rates of morphological errors per T-unit for the different learner types and conditions included in the sample.

Questions:
- **What kind of data set is this? Content? Format? Purpose?**
    - This is a corpus of timed and untimed essays by both heritage and second language learners learning Russian. 
    - The files are of XML format, and contain the essays as well as revisions by navtive Russian speaker.
- **How was the data created, collected, and processed?**
    - The 232 student essays are drawn from RULEC, the Russian Learner Corpus of Academic Writing. Errors in nouns, adjectives, and deteriminers (inflectional morphology errors) are determined by a native Russian-speaker and indicated in XML. Also, all "T-units", or sentence/independent clauses with any accompanying dependent clauses, are annotated.
- **How did the researcher organize the data?**
    - The researcher organized the data into 4 folders, "Heritage Learners Timed Texts", "Heritage Learners Untimed Texts", "L2 Learners Timed Texts" and "L2 Learners Untimed Texts" 
    - Each essay for each speaker is contained in one XML file.
- **What can we do with the data?**
    - Could compare the number of errors, where they occur between different types of speakers and in different types of essays.
- **After learning data-science methods, what do you think you will be able to do with the data?**
    - Could train machine learning algorithms to learn russian grammar, and automatically spot grammatical error in russian essays.
    - We could perform more statistical analyses of what's going on
