PHOIBLE is a collection of phonological data from 2155 languages around the world. In a given language it lists the segments found in the language, and how frequent that segment is found in the other 2155 listed languages. It also provides a map showing the distribution of the segment in languages across the world.
The authors are Steven Moran, Daniel McCloy, and Richard Wright of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig.
