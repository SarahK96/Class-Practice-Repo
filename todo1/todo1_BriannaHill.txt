To-Do #1

## DATASET 1:
Crúbadán language data for Tamazight

Developer/Researcher/Creator: Kevin Scannell

OLAC Record page: http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:crubadan.org:tzm
	File download: http://crubadan.org/languages/tzm
	
Size: 1192 documents, approximately 2.3 million words

Afro-Asiatic language (specifically Morocco)

Interesting Info:
	The download consisted of 4 files: character trigrams, word bigrams, and words (all
		with frequency of occurence). The 4th file is titled "tzm-urls.txt", which I
		assume is just the sources for all of the data.
	I'm very surprised at the amount of data available! I did my final paper on Amazigh
		for Ling 1800 (Endangered and Dying Languages) last fall and it seemed as though
		the language was still struggling to make a come back within the educational
		system. This data was published in August 2015, so it does seem to be making some
		progress! It makes me feel hopeful that revitalization efforts might be working!
	Spelling varies between Amazigh and Tamazight (and can be considered similar to Barber,
		but that was my Ling 1800 final). I'm more familiar and used to the first spelling.
		

## DATASET 2:
PANACEA Environment Corpus n-grams ES (Spanish)

Contact person given on source site: March Poch

Linghub page: http://linghub.lider-project.eu/metashare/f9be99cabbb611e28763000c291ecfc8c5698cb825a64a5f91cc4a4866705914#contactPerson
	Download page: http://metashare.upf.edu/repository/browse/panacea-environment-corpus-n-grams-es-spanish/f9be99cabbb611e28763000c291ecfc8c5698cb825a64a5f91cc4a4866705914/

Iberian Romance language

Size: This corpus is gigantic (in terms of what I've worked with), over 1gb of data. It goes
	from unigram data to 5-gram data and contains data for sentences and tokens amongst
	other things. I probably won't keep all of the data on my computer to use (especially
	considering how long it's taking to download). Everything is accompanied by frequency
	counts.

Interesting Info:
	All data was gathered in what is described as the "Environment" domain during PANACEA
		in 2011 (I guess at a conference since it was described as being collected in the
		context of PANACEA). PANACEA stands for Platform for Automatic, Normalized Annotation
		and Cost-Effective Acquisition of Language Resources for Human Language Technologies.
	It'll be interesting to actually dig into the files once they download since I'm a
		Spanish student and can probably interpet the data on a meaningful level and not
		just on a surface level. (Meaning more than just "these characters do this", but
		also "this meaning/phrase does this".)
