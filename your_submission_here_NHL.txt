makeup
size: 2.28 gb compressed, 5.79 gb uncompressed (TAR format)
language: english (but you can access yelp reviews of 12 cities across 4 countries)
format: JSON
license: there are 6 pages of the dataset terms and use that I don't want to read right now but is here: https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/assets/srv0/engineering_pages/af4b9cebfb4f/assets/vendor/dataset-challenge-dataset-agreement.pdf

github site also exits for examples: https://github.com/Yelp/dataset-examples

the data is split into several categories to allow for user to access the tags that they want to.
these are:
business (which include business data such as city, state, stars, review counts, attributes)
review (which includes the review of individuals, also includes user ids)
user (which includes user data, such as type of reviewer, elite status, average ratings)
check in (the check ins at the business to show on average how many people check in on the hour)
tip (gives tips and such to other readers).

it's basically a ton of data of yelp reviews to rage over. you can do quite a few things with this data, and it can be applied to businesses in what types of reviews they are getting without just looking at the stars.
it has the potential to really get into creating some detailed algorithm to predict what kind of reviewers restaurants are getting, what kind of reviews people tend to make, whether a 4.5 star restaurant is truly reliable, and the hottest spots in whatever city.
